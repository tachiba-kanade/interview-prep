"""
Custom Linear Algebra Library
Build your own mini linear algebra module from scratch.
Build your own set of functions or a simple class to represent and manipulate vectors and matrices

Add, sub, multiply, and divide vectors and matrices
Calculate the dot product and cross product of vectors
Calculate the determinant and inverse of matrices
Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices

q1. How will you represent a Vector?

- As a list?

- As a class?

q2. How will you represent a Matrix?

- As a list of lists?

- As a class with attributes like rows and cols?

q3. Can you implement the following operations?

    Vector addition, subtraction

    Scalar multiplication

    Dot product

    Cross product (3D)

    Vector norm

    Matrix addition

    Matrix multiplication

    Matrix transpose

q4. Can your library:
    - Check dimension compatibility automatically?
    - Raise proper errors?

q5. Can you implement:

    - Determinant (2x2 and 3x3)
    - Matrix inverse
    - Gaussian elimination
    - Advanced:Overload operators like +, -, *, @?

Final Challenge

    Can someone import your file like this?  from my_linear_algebra import Matrix, Vector
    And use it naturally?
