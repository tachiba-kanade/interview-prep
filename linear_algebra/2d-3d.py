"""
Simple 2D/3D Graphics Renderer

Goal:
Apply matrix transformations to render and animate shapes.

Libraries allowed:
math
Either: turtle OR pygame (No NumPy)

Core Questions

q1. How will you represent a point?

    [x, y]
    [x, y, z]

2. Can you create transformation matrices for:

    Scaling
    Rotation (2D)
    Translation (using homogeneous coordinates)

3. Can you:

    Multiply transformation matrix by a point?
    Transform every vertex of a shape?

4. Can you draw:

    A triangle?
    A square?

Can you animate:

    Continuous rotation?
    Scaling effect?
    Translation motion?
    3D Extension Questions

Can you implement:

    Rotation around X, Y, Z axes?
    Perspective projection?

Can you render:

    A wireframe cube?

Final Challenge

    Build a rotating 3D cube simulation.
